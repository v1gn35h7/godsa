A rate limiter controls the frequency of operations within a system. 
It manages multiple functions including processing incoming requests, monitoring resource availability, 
and making decisions to allow or reject requests based on defined policies. 
This helps maintain system performance and prevents overload situations.
system sjoukld be therat safe anf support concuttent cojnnedtions
support global and per user rate limitting


Application flow
=================================================================================
* Have to monitor resources (tokens) and refill tokens
* Processing incoming request 
* male descisions to allow or reject
* support both global and per user rate limitting
* should be threst safe and support concurrent connections


UML daiagram
============================================
* token bucket
    - KEY -- user id
    - total tokens
    - expire
* request 
    - user id 
    - body
